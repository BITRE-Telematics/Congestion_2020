<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs across each of the 11 selected Melbourne freight vehicle routes travel time congestion reduced across almost all routes but particularly on the longer and freight-intensive M1 East, which services the CBD and industrial areas in Melbourne’s south east.</p>
<p>Unlike in Sydney, reduction in mean excess uncertainty was fairly systematic and correlated in some degree with mean excess time congestion, i.e. routes that experienced higher reductions in mean excess time also experienced reductions in mean excess travel time uncertainty.</p>
