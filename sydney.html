Note: Ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time for each route.</div>
<p>The figure below shows all 13 selected Sydney freight vehicle routes and an index of the median excess travel time ratio (METR) – i.e. the ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time – across each route.</p>
<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs between 2019 and 2020 across each of the 13 selected Sydney freight vehicle routes. Reductions in travel time congestion were observed across almost all routes in Sydney but were most apparent on motorway routes, particularly those that in typical years have strong peaks related to commuter traffic. The city-bound directions on the M1 South and M5 are among these, but are less important in the freight network of the city than the M4 and M7, which saw smaller declines.</p>
<p>Decreases in travel time uncertainty were less consistent but fell on the most highly-weighted routes and in the city-wide measure.</p>
<p>Several routes had a deeper reduction in morning peaks than afternoon peaks before 5pm, which became the most congested time of day. This may be because of more lasting reductions in commuting trips than in school-related travel.</p>

<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty travelling from Glebe to Liverpool were at 2am and 5am at just over 39 minutes and an interquartile range of 23 minutes, 2 and 3 minutes less than 2019. The longest travel times and most uncertain travel times were in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median travel time of 49 minutes and an interquartile range of over 46 minutes, 2 minutes less and 1.5 minutes longer than 2019, respectively. Delays were apparent on Parramatta Road in particular.</p>
<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty travelling from Liverpool to Glebe were at 5am with a median travel time of 40 minutes and an interquartile range of 23 minutes, within a minute of 2019 levels. The longest travel times and greatest uncertainty were in the afternoon peak at 3 and 4 pm with the median travel time 47 minutes and an interquartile range of 38.5 minutes, down 4 and 10 minutes. Unlike the journey leaving the CBD (Glebe), travel into the CBD showed peaks in uncertainty in both the morning and afternoon, with delays most pronounced around the intersection of Liverpool and Parramatta Roads in Ashfield and near Canley Vale.</p>

<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty travelling from Casula to the M2 Motorway were at midnight and 3am with a median travel time of 37 minutes and an interquartile range of 16 minutes, both slightly higher than 2019. The longest median travel times and most uncertain travel times were in the afternoon peak at 3 and 5pm, with a median travel time of 48 minutes and an interquartile range of 44 minutes. This reverses the finding of 2019 when the morning peak was more congested. Delays were most prominent between Parramatta and Carlingford.</p>
<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty travelling from the M2 Motorway to Casula were at 4am with a median travel time of 36 minutes and an interquartile range of 15.5 minutes, slightly up on 2019. The longest travel times were at 3pm with 47.5 minutes and the greatest uncertainty were at 4pm with an interquartile range of 46 minutes, both well down from 2019. Like the journey from Casula, two peaks are present in the journey to Casula in the morning and afternoon respectively. Delays were most pronounced around Parramatta, Granville and Liverpool.</p>

<p>The best travel times for journeys from Blakehurst to Pymble were at 4am with a median of 36 minutes, while the lowest uncertainty were 5am with an interquartile range of 15 minutes, both slightly down on 2019. The longest median travel times and most uncertainty were in the “third peak” at 2am with a median of 44 minutes and the greatest uncertainty in the afternoon at 5pm with an interquartile range of 34 minutes, 5 and 11 minutes down on 2019. There was also a prominent peak in the morning. Delays were most apparent around Roselands in the South of the root, whereas delays around Macquarie Park, where many office workers commute, were eased.</p>
<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty travelling to Blakehurst were at 1pm and 11pm with a median of 37 minutes and an interquartile range of 18 minutes. The longest median travel times were at 3am with a median of 48 minutes, while the greatest uncertainty were in the afternoon peak at 5pm with an interquartile range of 39 minutes, down by 10.5 and 16 minutes, respectively. Delays were most apparent around Homebush.</p>
<p>In both directions there is an evident early morning peak which, though more significant for southbound trips, is the most delayed period of the day. The reason the “third peak” has become the most delayed period was because of improved speeds in other part of the day rather than a deterioration in that period.</p>

<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty travelling from the CBD (Cahill Expressway) to the M2 were at 4am with a median travel time of 44 seconds and an interquartile range of 1.5 minutes, similar to 2019. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were at 3pm with a median of 9.5 minutes and an interquartile range of nearly 9 minutes. Both best and worst times were similar to 2019 even whilst the METR improved and MEUR deteriorated substantially. Delays were more apparent on the Cahill Expressway and in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.</p>
<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty travelling from the M2 to the CBD were at 5am with a median travel time of 6 minutes and an interquartile range of less than a minute. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were at 6pm with a median travel time of 9 minutes and an interquartile range of just over 18 minutes, 4.5 and 12 minutes down on 2019. There appear to be spikes in uncertainty throughout the day, but this is likely just due to relatively sparse data. Delays in both peaks were apparent in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel but not on Warringah Expressway near Neutral Bay and North Sydney as in 2019.</p>
