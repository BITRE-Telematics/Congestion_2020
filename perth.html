Note: Ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time for each route.</div>
<p>The figure below shows all 10 selected freight vehicle routes in Perth and an index of the METR across each route.</p>
<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs between 2019 and 2020 across each of the 10 selected Sydney freight vehicle routes. Mean excess travel time congestion in Perth showed no clear pattern across routes, with some routes exhibiting increases mean excess travel time in one direction and reductions in the other, e.g. the highly-weighted Route 2. Reductions in mean travel time for the southbound direction of Route2, and smaller reduction on other highly-weighted routes, were sufficiently large to result in a reduction in the city-wide measure.</p>
<p>Reductions in travel time uncertainty were correlated with reductions in travel time congestion and, as such, saw a reduction in the city-wide measure of mean travel time uncertainty despite a lack of a clear pattern across the 10 freight vehicle routes.</p>

The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were during the morning 11am with a median travel time of 29.5 minutes and an interquartile range of 9 minutes. Travel times and uncertainty were slightly higher throughout the day and were largely unchanged from 2019. Mild delays were more apparent in the southern part of the route near the Pearce RAAF Base at Bullsbrook.</p>
<p>The best travel times and the lowest uncertainty travelling south were at midnight and 4am with a median travel time of 23 minutes and an interquartile range of 2 minutes. The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were experienced in the morning at 8 and 2am with a median of 27 minutes and an interquartile range of 6 minutes. There were no distinct peaks. The route was largely unchanged from 2019.</p>

<p>The best travel time and lowest uncertainty southbound from Hester Avenue to the Swan River was at 3am with a median time of 23 and an interquartile range of 2 minutes. The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were during the morning peak at 7 and 8am with a median travel time of 36 minutes and an interquartile range of 27 minutes, down 11 and 5.5 minutes, respectively, on 2019. There was also a smaller, but still significant, increase in travel time and uncertainty in the afternoon peak that was also less than in 2019. Like 2019 delays were most apparent in two sections: one near Edgewater (south of Joondalup) and the other near Stirling (closer to the CBD).</p>
<p>The best median travel time travelling north was 24 minutes at 5am and the lowest uncertainty were at 3am with an interquartile range of 1.5 minutes. The longest median travel times were at 4pm with a median travel time of 36 minutes and the greatest uncertainty were experienced at 5pm with an interquartile range of 27 minutes, slight increases from 2019. This afternoon peak was more congested than 2019 highlighting the lessened effect of COVID 19 led changes in commuting behavior on afternoon peaks. Unlike the southbound direction, there was no observable morning peak in northbound journeys, reflecting the significance of this route as a corridor for commuter’s heading south towards the CBD. Congestion was again most apparent near Stirling.</p>

Travel times and uncertainty remained elevated throughout business hours but to a lesser extent than 2019. Delays were again most apparent immediately south of the Swan River and near the intersection with the Roe Highway at Leeming.</p>
<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty heading south were at 11pm with a median time of 45 minutes and an interquartile range of 4 minutes. The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were experienced during the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median travel time of 58 minutes and an interquartile range of 32 minutes, up 5 and 8 minutes, respectively, on 2019. Unlike the northbound reverse route, travel time and uncertainty remained stable throughout the whole day except the peak hours in the afternoon, likely reflecting the significance of this route as a corridor for commuter traffic heading north towards the CBD. Like many afternoon peaks this route was largely unchanged from 2019 and actually saw an increase in peak period travel times and uncertainty.</p>

<p>The best travel times and the lowest uncertainty for eastbound travel to the CBD were experienced at 1am with a median travel time of 18 minutes and an interquartile range of 6 minutes. The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were at 11am with a median travel time of 25 minutes and an interquartile range of 20 minutes. Travel time uncertainty gradually increased between 4am and 11am where it formed a distinct peak, which is not necessarily associated with commuter traffic flows, making this route unique in this report. There was also a smaller peak in the afternoon. This pattern was largely unchanged from 2019. Delays were more apparent closer to Fremantle.</p>
<p>The best median travel time travelling west to Fremantle was 17 minutes at midnight and the lowest uncertainty were experienced at 1am with an interquartile range of 3 minutes. The longest and most uncertain travel times were at 10am with a median time of 24 minutes and an interquartile range of 18 minutes. Like the reverse direction, and more distinctly than in 2019, there was a distinct peak in business hours, albeit earlier. Delays were fairly evenly distributed across the route.</p>
<p>Elevated median travel time and uncertainty were observed during business hours in both directions.</p>
