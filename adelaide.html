<p>The figure below shows all 9 selected Adelaide freight vehicle routes and an index of the METR across each route.</p>
<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs across each of the 9 selected Adelaide freight vehicle routes. Adelaide routes exhibited no consistent increase in travel time congestion although the city-wide measure showed a small increase. Adelaide was alone amongst the 5 capital cities in showing an increase in mean excess travel time between 2019 and 2020, likely because of shorter-lived COVID-19 restrictions and less motorway routes with distinct commuting peaks. The only motorway route, the A2-M2, showed no appreciable change in either direction.</p>
<p>Changes in travel time uncertainty congestion were correlated with changes in time congestion leading to a slight increase in the city-wide mean excess uncertainty index measure.</p>

<p>For southbound trips, the lowest median travel times and uncertainty were at 6am with median travel times of 17 minutes and an interquartile range of 7 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were at 2am in the “third peak” with a median of 27 minutes and an interquartile range of 19 minutes, down 75 seconds and 15 minutes, respectively, on 2019. The morning and afternoon peaks witnessed in 2019 have been eliminated but the “third peak” with delays around Plympton remained.</p>
<p>The shortest median travel time and lowest travel time uncertainty northbound were at 1am and 11pm with a median travel time of 19 minutes and an interquartile range of 7.5 minutes. The longest median travel times were 23 minutes and the greatest travel time uncertainty with an interquartile range of 17 minutes, both at 3pm, down 3 and 5 minutes, respectively, on 2019. Unlike 2019 morning and afternoon peaks were not highly distinct although travel times and uncertainty were slightly elevated throughout business hours. There was a small “third peak” around 2am also apparent in this direction.</p>

<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty travelling north from Glenelg to Port Road were experienced at midnight with a median travel time of 13 minutes and an interquartile range of 2 minutes. The longest median travel times were in the afternoon peak at 5pm with a median of 17 minutes and the greatest uncertainty in the morning with an interquartile range of 10 minutes. Like 2019, there were two travel time peaks in 2020, but more equal than they were in 2019. Travel time uncertainty during business hours was higher than in 2019.</p>
<p>The shortest and least uncertain travel times southbound on the route were at midnight with a median travel time of 13 minutes an interquartile range of 79 seconds. The longest and most uncertain travel times were experienced in the afternoon peak at 3pm with a median time of 16 minutes and an interquartile range of 10 minutes, down 2 and 5 minutes, respectively, from 2019. Delays were fairly evenly distributed but were particularly evident near Sir Donald Bradman Drive and Grange Road.</p>
<p>The route exhibits significant travel time variability, in both directions, during business hours, presumably due to light vehicle traffic.</p>

The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median travel time of 29 minutes and an interquartile range of 20 minutes. These were similar to 2019; however the morning peak was not as pronounced in 2020. Delays were spread fairly evenly along the route but more apparent on Grand Junction Road and most apparent near the intersection with the Princes Highway (A1) at Gepps Cross in the afternoon peak.</p>

The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were in the morning peak at 8am with a median travel time of 18 minutes and an interquartile range of 10.5 minutes. Whilst the AM peak travel time and uncertainty were similar to 2019 levels, the afternoon peak disappeared, and peak uncertainty was down by 11 minutes. This is a rare example in this report of an afternoon peak improving more than a morning peak. Delays were fairly evenly distributed along the route.</p>
<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty northbound were at 3am with median times of 14 minutes and an interquartile range of 2 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were experienced during the morning peak at 8am with a median of 20 minutes and an interquartile range of 16 minutes, an increase of 1.5 and 5 minutes, respectively, from 2019. There was also a smaller but more extended peak in the afternoon. Delays were fairly evenly distributed along the route but with indications of greater delays at the intersection with North East Road (A10). This was largely unchanged from 2019.</p>

<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty on the northbound lanes were experienced at 2am with a median travel time of 25 minutes and an interquartile range of 3 minutes. The longest median travel times were at 4pm with a median of 33 minutes and the greatest uncertainty were at 5pm with an interquartile range of 29 minutes. There was a distinct afternoon peak in uncertainty but not travel times. Delays were more apparent at the beginning of the route.</p>
<p>The best travel times and the lowest uncertainty travelling south were at 3 and 4am with a median travel time of 25 minutes and an interquartile range of 6 minutes. The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were, like the reverse direction, experienced in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 34 minutes and an interquartile range of 26 minutes. Delays were again more evident in the southern portions of the route.</p>
<p>This route, like other key routes in Adelaide, exhibits greater travel time uncertainty throughout business hours in both directions. Moreover, the increase in travel time variation is more significant than the increase in median travel times, suggesting that a small but significant proportion of road users experience significant delays on this route. Overall there was little change from 2019 although the “third peak” was slightly more apparent.</p>

<p>The best median travel time travelling north from Noarlunga to the Port River Expressway was 35 minutes at 5am and the lowest uncertainty were experienced at 4am with an interquartile range of 8 minutes. The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were at 4pm during the afternoon peak with a median travel time of 47 minutes and an interquartile range of 36 minutes, down 3 and 9 minutes, respectively, from 2019. Delays during both peaks were more apparent in the surface road sections west of the CBD and on the North-South Motorway.</p>
<p>The best travel times and the lowest uncertainty for southbound trips were at 4 and 5am with a median travel time of 33 minutes and an interquartile range of 7 minutes. The longest and most uncertain travel times were experienced during the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 44 minutes and an interquartile range of 33 minutes, down 2 and 7 minutes, respectively, from 2019. There was also a small increase in median travel times in the morning peak. Delays were most apparent on the surface route sections and the northern parts of the Southern Expressway.</p>
<p>In both directions there was increased uncertainty throughout business hours.</p>
<p>The locations of the travel delays suggest both directions were congested primarily due to afternoon traffic leaving inner parts of Adelaide in opposite directions. Compared to 2019, the afternoon peak reduced but the morning peak showed little change in both directions.</p>
