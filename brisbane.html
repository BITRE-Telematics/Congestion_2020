<p>The figure below shows all 10 selected Brisbane freight vehicle routes and an index of the METR across each route.</p>
<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs across each of the 10 selected Brisbane freight vehicle routes. Most routes in Brisbane experienced reductions in travel time congestion, though less substantial than the reductions in Melbourne and Sydney, presumably due to shorter lockdowns and less intense peaks in ordinary conditions. In particular, the highly-weighted M1 experienced reductions in both directions.</p>
<p>There was no clear pattern in changes in travel time uncertainty across the 10 Brisbane routes, despite an increase in the city-wide measure.</p>

<p>The best travel times and least uncertainty heading south from the Bruce Highway to the Pacific Motorway were experienced at midnight with a median travel time of 24 minutes and an interquartile range of 2 minutes. The longest median travel times and most uncertainty were experienced in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 26 minutes and an interquartile range of 8 minutes, improvements of 6 and 7 minutes, respectively, from 2019. Comparing to 2019, uncertainty in the afternoon peak was reduced but still apparent, but the travel time peak was eliminated.</p>
<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty heading north from the Pacific Motorway to the Bruce Highway were experienced at 7pm with a median travel time of 24 minutes and an interquartile range of 103 seconds. The longest median travel times and most uncertainty were experienced in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 36 minutes and an interquartile range of 27 minutes, both of which were more severe than these of the southbound direction. Delays were most severe in the portion of the route north of Nudgee. The milder morning peak was largely eliminated but the afternoon peak remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>The afternoon peaks in both directions can be attributed to commuter traffic leaving the inner areas of Brisbane.</p>

<p>The best travel times and least uncertainty travelling from Bowen Hills to the Logan Motorway were experienced at 5am with a median travel time of 18.5 minutes and an interquartile range of 4.5 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were experienced in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 25 minutes and an interquartile range of 23 minutes, down 4 and 25 minutes, respectively, on 2019. Apart from this period, both travel time and uncertainty were relatively stable throughout the day. Delays were most apparent on the Centenary Highway near where it crosses the Brisbane River. Whilst the afternoon peak from 2019 remained, travel times and especially uncertainty during the peak were lower in 2020.</p>
<p>The best median travel times travelling from the Logan Motorway to Bowen Hills were 19 minutes at midnight and the least uncertain travel times were experienced at 10pm with an interquartile range of 4 minutes. The highest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were experienced in the morning peak at 7am with a median of 22 minutes and an interquartile range of 14 minutes, down 4 and 13 minutes, respectively, from 2019. Like the southbound route, the peak of uncertainty was much more prominent than the peak of median travel time and also reduced by a larger amount in 2020. Delays were again most significant on the Centenary Highway near where it crosses the Brisbane River.</p>

<p>The best median travel times travelling east from the Gateway Motorway to the Pacific Motorway was 9 minutes at 1am and the lowest uncertainty were experienced at 4am with an interquartile range of 38 seconds. The longest median travel times and highest uncertainty were experienced at 5pm with a median of 9.5 minutes and an interquartile range of 2 minutes. As in 2019 there was little variation in either measure throughout the day and no discernible peaks.</p>
<p>The shortest travel time and lowest uncertainty westbound from the Pacific Motorway to the Gateway Motorway were experienced at 4am with a median travel time of 9 minutes and an interquartile range of 44 seconds. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were experienced in the morning peak at 7 and 6am with a median travel time of 9.5 minutes and an interquartile range of 1.5 minutes, down 2.5 and 6 minutes, respectively, from 2019. The distinct peak in the morning with delays near the western end of the route near the Gateway Motorway that was evident in 2019 was not apparent in 2020.</p>

<p>The best travel times and lowest range of variation northbound from the Logan Motorway to Southern Cross Way were experienced at 4am with a median travel time of 26 minutes and an interquartile range of 8.5 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were experienced at 7am in the morning peak with a median of 34 minutes and an interquartile range of 29 minutes, down 3.5 and 8 minutes, respectively, from 2019. Delays were most apparent on the surface section (Ipswich Road) of this route and the Ipswich Motorway near Oxley.</p>
<p>The best travel times and least uncertainty southbound from Southern Cross Way to the Logan Motorway were at 4am with a median travel time of 26 minutes and an interquartile range of 9.5 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest range of variation were experienced in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 34 minutes and an interquartile range of 27 minutes, down 3 and 5 minutes, respectively, from 2019. Congestion was most apparent near Route 2 at Rocklea.</p>
<p>Like 2019 the data exhibits morning and afternoon travel time peaks and uncertainty in both directions. The morning peak is more severe than the afternoon peak northbound to Southern Cross Way, but the opposite is true for the reverse journey. This makes the M7-A7 route one of the most symmetrical routes in this report.</p>

<p>Eastbound from M7/A7 junction to the Gateway Motorway, the best travel times and lowest uncertainty were experienced at 3am with a median travel time of 11 minutes and an interquartile range of nearly 3 minutes. The longest median travel times and most uncertain travel time were experienced at 8am during the morning peak with a median of 19 minutes and an interquartile range of 21minutes, up 2 and 4.5 minutes, respectively, on 2019. Like 2019 there was also a prolonged afternoon peak. Delays were spread relatively evenly along the route but more apparent near the M3.</p>
<p>Westbound from the Gateway Motorway to the M7/A7 junction, the shortest median travel times and least uncertain travel time were at 3am with a median of 11 minutes and an interquartile range of 2 minutes. The longest median travel times and most uncertain travel times were experienced during the morning peak at 8am with a median of 15 minutes and an interquartile range of 15 minutes. There was also a similar afternoon peak. Again delays were more apparent near the M3 but also near Beaudesert Road in both peaks.</p>
<p>In both directions, average travel times were higher and the variation in travel greater during business hours. However, morning and afternoon peaks were more pronounced on the westbound route from the A7/M7 junction. The route was largely unchanged from 2019.</p>
